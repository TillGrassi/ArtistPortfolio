I want to create a personal artist website using React with TypeScript. I should be able to easily edit and extend the code myself. The site should be minimalistic and clean, with the focus on the paintings. Here are the core features:

1. Gallery View Simulation

The homepage should simulate an art gallery: each painting appears as if mounted on a white wall.

Clicking a right arrow turns the view 90 degrees to the next painting, like turning to face the next wall.

This rotation should be smooth and elegant.

Optional: disable or simplify the animation on mobile to avoid performance issues—just a simple slide or fade instead.

2. Painting Interaction

Each painting is clickable. Clicking opens a modal or a dedicated page with a detailed view.

The detail view should contain:

Title

Size (in cm)

Medium

Year

Availability status:

If available → Show a button linking to a contact form to inquire about purchase.

If sold → Show a greyed-out text like “Sold” instead of the button.

3. About Section

Include a page or scrollable section with a short biography, artistic vision, and possibly a photo.

4. Private Upload Interface

A password-protected page for the artist to upload new artworks.

It should contain a form with fields: image upload, title, size, medium, year, availability.

Upon submission, the artwork should be automatically added to the gallery.

Security: authentication should be real (not just frontend-based); keep it lightweight but proper.

5. Gallery Management Features

Paintings should support optional tags or categories (e.g., "landscape", "portrait") for future filtering.

Option to mark artworks as "new" to feature them separately.

Paintings should be lazy-loaded to optimize performance.

6. Contact Form

A simple form with name, email, and message, ideally connected to email forwarding or a backend like Replit DB or a free tier of an email service (e.g., EmailJS, Formspree).

7. Responsive Design

Must work on desktop and mobile.

On desktop, include the immersive rotation animation.

On mobile, use a swipe or tap-based navigation with simpler animation.

Please use clean and modular React + TypeScript, ideally with separate components for gallery, painting detail, contact form, about section, and admin upload panel. Use a simple CSS-in-JS or CSS modules system for styling.
